# MLOps
Building a full data pipline using xray dataset
"# MLOpsV2" 
## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll gain practical experience with MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) by working on a real-world problem: classifying chest X-ray images to diagnose pneumonia. You'll go through various stages, from data cleaning to deployment, learning how to manage an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Experience with Jupyter Notebooks

### Tools and Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- Matplotlib
- imbalanced-learn

These libraries should cover most requirements for this exercise, including data manipulation (NumPy, pandas), visualization (Matplotlib), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), image processing (OpenCV), and class imbalance treatment (imbalanced-learn).
# Data Version Control
I'll be using dvc to tack data , you can easily install it : pip install dvc 
# Model deployment 
I'll be using flask api , install it with : pip install flask 
here's what do looks like :
